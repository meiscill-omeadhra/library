## Against Literature
I am anti-literature. Most of the time, a reading hobby is merely an inconsequential form of intellectual masturbation. One should look within before looking to any writer or philosopher for wisdom. Learn to listen to your heart, trust your intuition, think adogmatically, spend time outside, and have fun. You will learn more doing this than anything else.

The only important literature is sacred texts. These documents contain generations of our ancestors accumulated knowledge. They are to be analyzed, as they contain ancient wisdom that has been lost with time and modernity.
